Judge Blocks President Obama's Immigration Order
A federal judge in Texas is working to block President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen issued a temporary injunction that gives a coalition of 26 states time to pursue a lawsuit that aims to permanently stop the president's orders.

The White House said the Justice Department will appeal the decision.

The ruling puts on hold Obama's orders that could spare as many as 5 million people who are in the UnitedÂ States illegally from deportation.

On Tuesday, the White House issued a statement saying Monday's ruling "wrongly prevents" the president's "lawful, commonsense polices" from taking effect.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the federal judge's ruling was no surprise, citing Obama's repeated comments about the limits of his authority.
