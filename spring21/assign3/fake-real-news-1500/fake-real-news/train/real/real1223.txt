White House: GOP Has Failed to Put ‘Points on the Board’
Republicans have controlled Congress for a little more than two months now, but a top White House official says GOP lawmakers so far have failed to put any “points on the board” and that the president is driving the debate in Washington.

As House and Senate Republicans prepare to lay out their budget priorities this week, senior White House adviser Brian Deese offered a blunt assessment of the political landscape, saying that the majority party in Congress has simply been reacting to President Barack Obama’s proposals rather than advancing its own.
