Obama Has Hit The DGAF Portion Of His Presidency, And This Video Is Proof
President Barack Obama has officially hit the stage of his presidency where he does not give one f**k.

At least that's according to a video that played ahead of his speech at the 2015 White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night.

After the video played, Obama said he was recently asked if he had anything left on his presidential bucket list.

"Well, I have something that rhymes with 'bucket list,'" Obama said. "Take executive action on immigration? Bucket. New climate regulations? Bucket, it's the right thing to do."
