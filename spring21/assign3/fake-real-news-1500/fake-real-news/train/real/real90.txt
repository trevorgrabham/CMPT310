The Weeds: could more corruption fix American politics?
Yes, the New Hampshire primary was this week — and we found an especially wonky way to talk about it.

There's a paper that came out last year called "Political Realism: How Hacks, Machines, Big Money, and Back-Room Deals Can Strengthen American Democracy." If you're a listener of The Weeds, you'll almost certainly find it fascinating.

Author Jonathan Rauch argues that deals, rewards, and favors are all essential parts of actually making the government work. If political parties were stronger — if individuals could donate lots of money, rather than a little — he thinks the government would be able to get even more done.

Listen to Ezra, Matt, and me dive into what this means for the 2016 election in this week's episode — which you can find, as always, below and on iTunes.
