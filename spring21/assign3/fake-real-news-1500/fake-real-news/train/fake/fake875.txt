VIDEO: Cop Crashes Car and Runs Away When More Cops Arrive

An award-winning California state trooper was caught on camera fleeing the scene after crashing his patrol car into a parked vehicle and a utility pole, snapping it in half, on Thursday afternoon at 2:30 p.m.
When other officers approached and asked him to explain what happened, officer Daniel Kenney refused to get out of the vehicle. With at least three officers surrounding the front end of the car, Kenney reverses and then speeds away past a cameraman across the street.
Kenney, a state park K-9 officer, is now on paid administrative leave.

Nearly 1,000 homes and business in the area were left without power.
Officers placed Kenney in handcuffs when he eventually decided to pull over. He was taken to a hospital where it was determined that he was not intoxicated.
A man inside the parked vehicle which Kenney struck suffered minor injuries and was taken to the hospital, according to Action News Now. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple
