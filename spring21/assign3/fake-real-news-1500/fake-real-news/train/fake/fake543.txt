I have time thinking move city. Live in northern Spain and in recent years have been tens of thousands of Moroccans. Rape of young girls is now commonplace. The schools are filled with Muslim children, many veiled women, mosques everywhere and Maghrebi youths committing crimes. I want to go to a small traditional village where not see anything Islamic. jo503 November 7, 2016 @ 4:04 am 
Poor girl… Having a trouble in her country and fleeing it for having a better life… And then we ask ourselves why Europe is falling down… People are scared being called racist so they shut up or leave… Poor little girl…
