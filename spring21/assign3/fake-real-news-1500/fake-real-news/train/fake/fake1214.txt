So you think SUVs are safe? Shocking video
Report Copyright Violation So you think SUVs are safe? Shocking video Back in the 70's everybody was driving rear wheel drive cars in the worst of snowstorm. My dad was even going hunting and fishing with his Chevrolet because that all there was back then. Now every SUV ad tries to sell us the lie that SUVs are safer in the snow and you just can't drive in the snow without one. Re: So you think SUVs are safe? Shocking video SUV's are fine...the idiot driver was going to fast and went into the snow filled shoulder. Drivers fault...not the SUV.
