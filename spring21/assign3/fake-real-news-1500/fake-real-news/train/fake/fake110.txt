Homeless man looking a bit down today for some reason
Homeless man looking a bit down today for some reason 27-10-16 A HOMELESS man who is usually upbeat seems a bit down today and no one’s quite sure why. Bill McKay, 56, usually sings Born in the USA while greeting passers-by but locals claim he doesn’t quite seem his usual jolly self. Local Barista, Julian Cook said, “He’s usually so full of life. Dancing about the place, proposing to every girl who walks past him and then laughing when they walk off. But today he’s just sat there looking bloody depressed. “I wonder why he’s in such a mood? “ Usually I’d give him a cup of coffee and a bit of cake for being so entertaining but if he’s going to just sit there looking like he wants to cry then he can sod off.” When asked why he was so down, McKay simply shook his head, muttered something about the government and then looked off down the street with a heavy sigh. Cook added: “See. What’s funny about that?”
