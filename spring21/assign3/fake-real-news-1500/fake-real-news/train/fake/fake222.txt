WOW! What Josh Earnest admitted about Obamacare is stunning (because it’s true) Posted at 1:53 pm on October 27, 2016 by Doug P.

White House Spokesman Josh Earnest actually conformed to reality: . @PressSec concedes middle-class families not eligible for tax credits are being hit by higher premiums on ObamaCare. .
