Major Democratic Donor: African-Americans are “Seriously F***ed In The Head”

In fact, they were so opposed to civil rights that they formed the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War (remember Robert Byrd? It’s no coincidence that he was a KKK Grand Wizard you know!)
But instead of owning up to their past misdeeds, Democrats peddle the fiction of a “reset” that saw the racists in their party migrate to the GOP, allowing them to become a kinder, more tolerant organization. This narrative unravels, however, when one hears what one of the party’s biggest donors had to say about African-Americans who don’t vote the way he wants them to.
As one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party, Benjamin Barber was easily able to gain access to a fundraiser for the Clinton campaign. The billionaire had trouble understanding how African-Americans could possibly vote differently from him however, expressing the sentiment that they were “seriously f***ed in the head” for supporting the GOP and comparable to Jews who sold out their people during the Holocaust.
