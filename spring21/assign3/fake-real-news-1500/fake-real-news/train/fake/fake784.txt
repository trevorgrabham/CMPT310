VIDEO: Watch as Hillary Needs Assistance… To Climb One Step
Hillary Clinton is just fine . 
She’s not sick. That weird neurological problem she had? All cured. 
Pneumonia? Done. 
Blurry vision? Concussion? Not a problem. 
Right? 
Well, maybe not. 
Because if Hillary Clinton is in tip-top health, then why does she need help making her way up one little step. 
In this video from The American Mirror , we can see Clinton heading up to a podium to make an appearance in Lake Worth, Texas. 
As she attempted to take a step up to a small riser, an aide quickly offered her support – which she clearly needed. 
Take a look: Hillary heads over to the overflow area to say hello to the crowd in Lake Worth, Florida. But ya know, no enthusiasm there. 🙄 pic.twitter.com/3cUDK245XK 
You can also clearly see another assistant standing behind her, just in case she doesn’t make it up all the way.
