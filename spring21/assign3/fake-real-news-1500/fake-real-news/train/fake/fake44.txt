Quoting: Anonymous Coward 67204360 There is a simple economic explanation for this development.USA and Whites are now losing influence at an alarming rate. White companies are increasingly complaining about losing access to non-white markets while China's influence is growing there fast, leading, among others, to bank and financial crises like Deutsche Bank. Also, more and more countries are banning white culture and languages.The last 500 years whites controlled all manufacturing, arms production and finance and needed only resources from others. Now whites are losing all that, and are about to become irrelevant when non-whites soon control resources, manufacturing, markets and finance..
